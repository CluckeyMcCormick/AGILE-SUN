# AGILE-SUN
This was a group effort between myself and three other students - [Timothy Holocombe](https://github.com/timothyholcombe128), [Forrest Tappan](https://github.com/forresttappan281), and [Johnathan Burtson](https://github.com/jburtson).

Our goal for this project was to quickly create a specific Ruby-on-Rails webapp, utilizing an AGILE development method. The webapp would the be hosted on Heroku - this version of the app is currently located [here](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps/murmuring-thicket-1020), complete with some dummy data.

The specific webapp we were tasked with creating was **CI Finder** - a talent-search website. Users would need to be able to create their own accounts, and then add talents to their profile. Each talent would need to have an associated rating. Anyone visiting the site would need to be able browse by talents or browse by users.

The website itself was easy enough to build - the real challenge was in working with the Models.

This was only my second time working with a database, and the relationship between Talents and Users was a information rich many-to-many relationship. I had to teach myself what a join table was, and implement the object creation myself.

Looking back, the solution wasn't all that difficult; but I was moving into unknown territory - Ruby, databases, web design. It was all new, and pretty difficult, but the project came out pretty well.
